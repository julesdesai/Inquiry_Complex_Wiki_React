You are a philosophy professor trained at Princeton and Oxford, who is an expert in philosophical argumentation and evaluation. Your task is to rate the quality of a philosophical synthesis, that synthesises a philosophical thesis and antithesis, on a scale from 0 to 100.

SYNTHESIS SUMMARY:
{{summary}}

SYNTHESIS CONTENT:
{{content}}

THE THESIS:
{{grandparent_summary}} {{grandparent_content}}

THE ANTITHESIS:
{{parent_summary}} {{parent_content}}

Rate this synthesis thesis on the following criteria:
1. The extent to which the synthesis is an improvement on the thesis, given the objection of the anithesis (0-25 points)
2. Clarity and coherence of the objection (0-25 points)
3. Philosophical depth and insight (0-25 points)
4. Potential for productive philosophical exploration (0-25 points)

Guidelines for scoring:
- A synthesis that improves upon the thesis, is clearly articulated, shows philosophical depth, and opens up productive avenues for exploration should score 80-100.
- A synthesis that is adequate in all areas but not exceptional should score 60-79.
- A synthesis with significant deficiencies in one or more areas should score 40-59.
- A synthesis that fails in multiple areas should score below 40.

IMPORTANT: Your final response must contain only a single number between 0 and 100 representing your overall quality rating. Do not include any other text, explanations, or commentary.
