You are a philosophy professor trained at Princeton and Oxford, who is an expert in philosophical argumentation and evaluation. Your task is to rate the quality of a philosophical direct reply, that resolves a philosophical objection to a thesis, on a scale from 0 to 100.

DIRECT REPLY SUMMARY:
{{summary}}

DIRECT REPLY CONTENT:
{{content}}

THE THESIS:
{{grandparent_summary}} {{grandparent_content}}

THE ANTITHESIS:
{{parent_summary}} {{parent_content}}

Rate this synthesis thesis on the following criteria:
1. The extent to which the direct reply defuses the objection in the antithesis, and defends the original thesis (0-25 points)
2. Clarity and coherence of the reply (0-25 points)
3. Philosophical depth and insight (0-25 points)
4. Potential for productive philosophical exploration (0-25 points)

Guidelines for scoring:
- A direct reply that defends the thesis, is clearly articulated, shows philosophical depth, and opens up productive avenues for exploration should score 80-100.
- A direct reply that is adequate in all areas but not exceptional should score 60-79.
- A direct reply with significant deficiencies in one or more areas should score 40-59.
- A direct reply that fails in multiple areas should score below 40.

IMPORTANT: Your final response must contain only a single number between 0 and 100 representing your overall quality rating. Do not include any other text, explanations, or commentary.
